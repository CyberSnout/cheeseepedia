<h2>History</h2>
The Colerain Ave Showbiz Pizza Place opened up November 11, 1981 opening in front of the former Gold Circle Mall as the 2nd Showbiz Pizza Store in Ohio (2nd after <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)" >}}">Sharonville</a>). The store featured 'The Show Room, Sports Room, 60 Arcade games, a merry-go-round, and 'a magic cave'.' Fun Fact Colerain had unique showroom walls which unlike normal stores had an entrance in the middle of the wall. In 1982 apart of support for the Bengals getting into Super Bowl XVI Showbiz Pizza ran a promotion at Colerain & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)" >}}">Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)</a>. The event would happen January 24th in which you'd watch the event on a 'Wide Screen TV' and also bring in cans of soup in return 'Four Free Game Tokens and the soup goes to charity'. <sup>(6)</sup>
In 1985 two events were held at the Showbiz one being the Greater Cincinnati Youth for Christ hosted a social on March 31st & June 16th from 8-11pm. The event was titled 'Night Light' which featured Pizza Buffet, Live Music from the Willoughby-Wilson Band.<sup>(7)</sup> <sup>(8)</sup>The other event hosted was a 'Teen Dance' even which was a charity event to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy Association which would take place on July 12th.<sup>(9)</sup>
By 1987 Showbiz Pizza Place & Pizza Time Theatre had merged together with the ads beginning to reflect that. Since by that point every other SPP & PTT in the area had closed only Colerain & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd)" >}}">Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd)</a> would be the only stores to show on these ads.<sup>(10)</sup>
In 1989 The original Showbiz Pizza Place sign would be removed with the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza sign being installed in its place. Colerain would receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1988 Remodel Program</a> around the same time. This would remove the last remains of the Showbiz Pizza Place branding.<sup>(11)</sup>
Beginning in mid <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (4394 Eastgate Square Dr)" >}}">Cincinnati, OH (4394 Eastgate Square Dr)</a> had begin showing up in advertisements in the area following its June 1990 opening. <sup>(12)</sup>
In April 1991 the Rock Afire Explosion would undergo Concept Unification turning the show into <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage" >}}">Munch's Make Believe Band</a>. Then in late 1991 the Showbiz Pizza sign would be removed and replaced with a brand new 'Chuck E. Cheese's sign'<sup>(11)</sup>
on July 11th 1991 (11am-7pm) Chuck E. Cheese's would hold an open house for Assistant Restaurant Managers. Where you would visit and Dana Buck (Regional Recruiter) would tell all about the 'excellent starting salary along with a Great Quality of Life!'<sup>(14)</sup>
In late 1992 <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)" >}}">Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)</a> began to re-appear on advertisements as the store re-opened as a Chuck E. Cheese's after closing in 1984 as a Showbiz Pizza Place. Along with that <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Louisville, KY (5743 Preston Hwy)" >}}">Louisville, KY (5743 Preston Hwy)</a> would begin showing up on the advertisements despite not being nearby to other locations on said advertisements. The store is removed in November 1997 after closing.<sup>(15)</sup>
on July 20, 1993 a 'Informational Open House' was held by 'Chuck E. Cheese's/ShowBiz' to tell restaurant managements the facts about their growth in 1993 and their 'livable' schedules. This event would also have 'Paul Scappechi, Regional V.P. and Dan High, District Manager' to visit It is interesting to note they both misspell Colerain as 'Collerain' and Chuck E. Cheese's as 'Chuch E. Cheese'<sup>(16)</sup>
Colerain would receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1992 Remodel Program</a> in 1992 at around the same time that Sharonville would open up. In the showroom Colerain featured 'Silver Awards' which were for the most part only installed in brand new 1992 stores. Despite that Colerain had 5 Silver Awards gaining them most likely due to Colerain and Sharonville opening/remodeling at the same time.
In 1996 they would receive <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1 (1994)</a> while also installing the standard Skytubes, New Game Package, and Kid Check the store would also receive new artwork such as the magazines and sports fixtures but also a new exterior replacing the 'Chuck E.

They would also around the same time install a single <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Red CEC Tickets (CEC Décor)" >}}">Red CEC Tickets (CEC Décor)</a> near the entrance on the left wall.
During Summer 2009 the store would receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a>. During the remodel they'd receive a new game package and expand the store from 10,200 sq ft to 10,406 sq ft.<sup>(20)</sup><sup>(21)</sup>

The Toddler Zone fence was removed in late 2017. Leaving a more open environment as no games were put in its place.
Colerain would receive another Game Package in August 2018. At the same time the animatronic show would see increased maintenance which it hadn't seen since 2016.
On September 22, 2019, Colerain would close after 38 years due to the owner of the property increasing rent on the lease and CEC Entertainment no longer seeing reason to keep the store open.  After closing some pieces of art were sent to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (4394 Eastgate Square Dr)" >}}">4394 Eastgate Square Dr</a>. The posters sent over were <i>Grand Marshal of Games' (CEC Décor)|Grand Marshal of Games', </i>Ambassador of Fun' (CEC Décor)|Ambassador of Fun' and two <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Red CEC Tickets (CEC Décor)" >}}">'Red CEC Tickets'</a>, Along with several showroom chairs, the Kid Check stand, & Parts of arcade games such as 'Simpson Soccer' and 'Pop It for Gold'.
